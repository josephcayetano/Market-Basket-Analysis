    "B1. By definition, market basket analysis is \"a data mining technique retailers use to increase sales by better understanding customer purchasing patterns\" (Amruta, 2024, par. 1). The market basket technique analyzes the dataset by converting the original dataset into a transactions data. It groups the dataset by using the column OrderID, so that every unique OrderID represents a separate transaction in the dataset. Each transaction has a group of products that were purchased together. The market basket analysis focuses on identifying frequent itemsets. If there is a group of products that is purchased together frequently, it will be considered as a frequent itemset. Once frequent itemsets are identified, association rules are created. Association rules show the relationship between different items purchased together. There are a couple of expected outcomes when performing the market basket technique in the dataset. First, by discovering the products that are often purchased together, the organization can sell those products as a bundle at a discounted price, resulting in increased sales by encouraging customers to buy more items. Second, the organization can improve its product recommendations to customers."

The products purchased are: RED RETROSPOT SUGAR JAM BOWL, GLASS SONGBIRD STORAGE JAR, and REGENCY SUGAR BOWL GREEN. Looking at the dataset, while there are three separate rows for three different products, those three products still came from a single transaction because they have the same OrderID value and the same InvoiceDate value. This is an example of a single transaction that would be in the transaction data to be used for market basket analysis. "

Label encoding converts the string values into integer values and it will treat the values simply as different categories, not as ranked or ordered data. In this code, I used the replace() function to encode 'Credit Card' as 0 and 'PayPal' as 1 in the PaymentMethod column."

    "I performed one-hot encoding for the Region variable because one-hot encoding is appropriate for variables with values that have no meaningful order between them, which describes Region. One-hot encoding treats each value in the Region variable independently, which makes sense because there is no region that is less than or greater than the other. I used the get_dummies() function, which creates two new columns: Region_Northeast and Region_Southeast. Rows that had the value 'Northeast' in the Region column will have a value of 1 in the Region_Northeast column, 0 otherwise. Rows that had the value 'Southeast' in the Region column will have a value of 1 in the Region_Southeast column, 0 otherwise. I converted the two new columns into an int data type to have numeric values instead of boolean values. "

    "<p>C1d. For C1a, the two ordinal variables that I chose are OrderPriority and CustomerOrderSatisfaction, and the two nominal variables that I chose are PaymentMethod and Region. The variable OrderPriority is an ordinal variable because its values 'High' and 'Medium' can be ranked where 'High' is greater or more important than 'Medium'. The variable CustomerOrderSatisfaction is also an ordinal variable because its values are ranked and have a meaningful order where 'Very Satisfied' is better than 'Satisfied', and 'Satisfied' is better than 'Dissatisfied'. The variable PaymentMethod is a nominal variable because its values 'Credit Card' and 'Paypal' have no meaningful order and they are simply different modes of payment. There is no payment that is better or worse than the other. The variable Region is also a nominal variable because its values 'Northeast' and 'Southeast' are not ranked and they are simply labels for different areas. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>For C1b, I performed the appropriate encoding method for each variable. For the variable OrderPriority, I performed ordinal encoding because ordinal encoding is used for variables that have a hierarchy, which OrderPriority has in its values where 'High' is greater or more important than 'Medium'. Ordinal encoding converts the string values into integer values that reflect their natural order. I used the replace() function to encode 'High' as 2 and 'Medium' as 1 in the OrderPriority column. For the variable CustomerOrderSatisfaction, I performed ordinal encoding because ordinal encoding is used for variables that have a meaningful order, which CustomerOrderSatisfaction has in its values where 'Very Satisfied' is better than 'Satisfied', and 'Satisfied' is better than 'Dissatisfied'. Ordinal encoding converts the values into integer values that reflect the order of the satisfaction levels. I used the replace() function to encode 'Very Satisfied' as 5, 'Satisfied' as 4, 'Prefer not to answer' as 3, 'Dissatisfied' as 2, and 'Very Dissatisfied' as 1 in the CustomerOrderSatisfaction column. For the variable PaymentMethod, I performed label encoding because label encoding is used for variables that have no hierarchy and have very few values, which describes PaymentMethod. Label encoding converts the string values into integer values and it will treat the values simply as different categories, not as ranked or ordered data. I used the replace() function to encode 'Credit Card' as 0 and 'PayPal' as 1 in the PaymentMethod column. For the variable Region, I used one-hot encoding because one-hot encoding is appropriate for variables with values that have no meaningful order between them, which describes Region. One-hot encoding treats each value in the Region variable independently, which makes sense because there is no region that is less than or greater than the other. I used the get_dummies() function, which creates two new columns: Region_Northeast and Region_Southeast. Rows that had the value 'Northeast' in the Region column will have a value of 1 in the Region_Northeast column, 0 otherwise. Rows that had the value 'Southeast' in the Region column will have a value of 1 in the Region_Southeast column, 0 otherwise.</p>\n",

    "<p> C3. In this code, I used the Apriori Algorithm to generate frequent itemsets and association rules from the binary matrix data. I set the minimum support threshold to 1%, which means only itemsets with at least 1% support will be considered frequent. The frequent itemsets are stored in the variable frequent_itemsets. Then, I used the association_rules() function to generate association rules from the frequent itemsets. Lift is the metric that was used to generate the rules and this metric measures how likely multiple items are to be purchased together compared to being purchased independently. Rules that have a lift value of at least 1 are the only rules to be included in the association rules table because we are only interested in rules that have a positive association.

Confidence measures how likely the consequent (right) will get purchased if the antecedent (left) is purchased. A higher confidence value means stronger association between the consequent and antecedent. Lift measures how likely multiple items are to be purchased together compared to being purchased independently. A rule that has a lift value of at least 1 indicates that the products are more likely to be purchased together than if they were purchased randomly.</p>"

The association rules can be used to enhance product recommendations by recommending complementary products to customers while their shopping, which increases the likelihood of them buying more items. Using one of our association rules for example, knowing that 'DOLLY GIRL BEAKER' and 'DOLLY GIRL CHILDRENS BOWL' frequently get purchased together, if the customer buys 'DOLLY GIRL BEAKER' they should also get recommended to buy 'DOLLY GIRL CHILDRENS BOWL' because those two items frequently get purchased together.

    "D3. To answer the question from part A1 about \"Which products are frequently purchased together?\", we have identified the products that were frequently purchased together based on the market basket analysis results. There are two recommended courses of actions for frequently purchased products. The first recommended action is to display frequently purchased together products during the online checkout process. For example, if a customer selects the item 'PLASTER IN TIN SPACEBOY', they should get recommended to buy 'ALARM CLOCK BAKELIKE PINK' as a complementary purchase because both items are often purchased together based on the market basket analysis results. This increases the likelihood of customers buying more items, and thus increases sales. The second recommended action is to bundle commonly purchased together products with a slight discount to encourage customers to buy multiple items together, increasing the overall order size. For example, bundling the frequently purchased together items like 'ALARM CLOCK BAKELIKE RED', 'CHILDRENS CUTLERY SPACEBOY' and 'SPACEBOY BIRTHDAY CARD' together with a slight discount, it encourages customers to purchase them all together. This drives more sales to the business."
